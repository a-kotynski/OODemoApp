/*
 *  Inheritance is when you have a base class and a class that inherits from that base class
 *  Inheritance is not code-sharing
 *  for code-sharing use seperate library or separate class and referene it in two different locations
    
 *  Is-a relationship
 *  Need to share common logic
 *  Sharing just properties or method signatures is not enough
 *  Inheritance can put you in a corner
 *  You need to ask the question: What is the point?
